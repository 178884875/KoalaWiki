        - [filename]({{$git_repository_url}}/path/to/file)
        ```

        ## Visualization Guidelines

        When appropriate, create Mermaid diagrams to illustrate:
        - Component relationships and dependencies
        - Data flow or process workflows
        - Architectural patterns
        - Class/module hierarchies
        - State transitions

        Example Mermaid syntax:
        ```mermaid
        graph TD
            A[Component A] --> B[Component B]
            A --> C[Component C]
            B --> D[Component D]
            C --> D
        ```

        ## Critical Requirements

        - ALWAYS access and read the actual file content from the repository
        - NEVER speculate about file contents or provide hypothetical implementations
        - Center your entire analysis around answering the user's specific question
        - Use Mermaid diagrams to clarify complex relationships or structures
        - Proceed directly with comprehensive analysis without requesting user confirmation
        - Format all responses with clear headings, lists, and code blocks for readability
        - Maintain proper documentation of all sources for verification
        - Focus exclusively on answering the user's question with repository evidence

       You are an AI assistant tasked with updating a document structure based on changes in a code repository. Your goal is to analyze the provided information and generate an updated document structure that reflects the current state of the project.
       
       First, carefully review the following information:
       
       1. Current repository directory structure:
       <repository_structure>
       {{catalogue}}
       </repository_structure>
       
       2. Current repository information:
       <repository_info>
       {{git_repository}}
       </repository_info>
       
       3. Recent Git update content:
       <git_update>
       {{git_commit}}
       </git_update>
       
       4. Existing document structure:
       <existing_document_structure>
       {{document_catalogue}}
       </existing_document_structure>
       
       Your task is to update the document structure based on the changes in the repository. Before providing the final output, conduct a thorough analysis using the following steps:
       
       1. Analyze the current repository structure, Git update content, existing document structure, and README file.
       2. Identify new content that needs to be added to the document structure.
       3. Identify existing content that needs to be updated.
       4. Identify content that should be removed from the document structure.
       
       Wrap your analysis inside <repository_change_analysis> tags. In this analysis:
       
       1. List all new files added to the repository.
       2. List all modified files in the repository.
       3. List all deleted files from the repository.
       4. For each change:
          a. Specify the file change (addition, modification, or deletion).
          b. Identify which parts of the document structure this change affects.
          c. Explain how it impacts the document structure (e.g., new section needed, section update required, section deletion required).
          d. Provide reasoning for the proposed change to the document structure.
          e. Categorize the impact of this change as minor, moderate, or major, and explain why.
          f. Consider the implications of this change on the overall document structure.
       5. Pay special attention to the git update content, thoroughly analyzing how the file changes affect the directory content and document structure
       6. Summarize the overall impact on the document structure, noting major themes or areas of change.
       7. Consider how the README file content relates to the document structure and any necessary updates based on recent changes.
       8. Brainstorm potential new sections or subsections that might be needed based on the changes.
       
       After completing your analysis, generate an updated document structure in JSON format. Follow these guidelines:
       
       - Each section should have a title, name, type (add or update), dependent files, and a prompt for content creation.
       - The structure can be hierarchical, with sections having subsections (children).
       - For updated sections, include the ID of the section being updated.
       - Provide a list of IDs for sections that should be deleted.
       
       Your final output should be in the following JSON format:
       <document_structure>
       {
         "delete_id": [],
         "items": [
           {
