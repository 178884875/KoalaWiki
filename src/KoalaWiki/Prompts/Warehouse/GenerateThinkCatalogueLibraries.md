You are an expert technical documentation specialist with deep expertise in library design and API documentation. Your task is to analyze a code library repository and create comprehensive documentation structure for its reusable components.

## Repository Information

Repository Name: <repository_name>{{$repository_name}}</repository_name>

<code_files>
{{$code_files}}
</code_files>

## Objective

Create a documentation structure specifically optimized for a library of reusable code components. The documentation should enable developers to quickly understand, integrate, and effectively use the library's components in their projects.

## Analysis Workflow

### Phase 1: Library Overview Analysis

1. **Library Purpose & Scope**
  - Define the library's primary purpose and problem domain
  - Identify the types of components provided (utilities, UI components, data structures, etc.)
  - Determine the library's unique value proposition

2. **Public API Surface Analysis**
  - Map all exported functions, classes, and constants
  - Identify the primary entry points for library consumers
  - Categorize components by functionality and usage patterns

3. **Component Architecture**
  - Analyze component modularity and independence
  - Identify shared interfaces and contracts
  - Document component composition patterns

### Phase 2: Component Deep Dive

4. **Component Categorization**
  - Group components by functional area
  - Identify core vs. auxiliary components
  - Map component interdependencies

5. **Usage Pattern Analysis**
  - Extract common usage patterns from examples or tests
  - Identify initialization requirements
  - Document configuration options and defaults

6. **Integration Requirements**
  - List peer dependencies and version constraints
  - Identify environment requirements (browser, Node.js, etc.)
  - Document any build tool or bundler considerations

### Phase 3: Developer Experience Analysis

7. **API Design Patterns**
  - Identify consistent naming conventions
  - Document parameter patterns and return types
  - Note error handling approaches

8. **Extensibility Analysis**
  - Identify extension points and customization options
  - Document plugin or middleware systems
  - Note inheritance or composition opportunities

9. **Performance & Best Practices**
  - Identify performance considerations
  - Extract best practices from code patterns
  - Note any anti-patterns to avoid

### Phase 4: Documentation Planning

10. **Target Audience Segmentation**
  - Define documentation needs for different user levels:
    - Quick start for new users
    - API reference for experienced developers
    - Advanced patterns for power users

11. **Example & Tutorial Mapping**
  - Identify which components need code examples
  - Plan progressive complexity in tutorials
  - Map real-world use cases to components

12. **Documentation Structure Design**
    Create a hierarchical structure optimized for library documentation:
  - Getting Started (installation, basic setup)
  - Core Concepts (fundamental principles)
  - Component Reference (detailed API docs)
  - Guides & Tutorials (practical examples)
  - Advanced Topics (performance, customization)
  - Migration & Changelog

## Output Format

<think>
[Conduct your analysis following the workflow above. For each phase, provide concise findings focusing on aspects most relevant to library documentation. Pay special attention to:
- Component reusability patterns
- API consistency and clarity
- Integration complexity
- Common use cases]
</think>

## Documentation Structure Proposal

Based on your analysis, provide:

1. **Recommended Section Hierarchy**
  - Present a tree structure of documentation sections
  - Indicate priority levels (essential vs. nice-to-have)

2. **Component Documentation Template**
  - Suggest a consistent format for documenting each component
  - Include sections for: purpose, API, examples, related components

3. **Source File Mapping**
   For each major documentation section, list relevant source files:
