# ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

## Enhanced Structure Analysis
- **Directory Patterns**: Identify key directories (src/, app/, lib/, tools/, bin/, .github/, docs/, examples/)
- **Configuration Files**: Analyze package.json, requirements.txt, Dockerfile, CI configs, documentation configs
- **Technology Stack**: Identify programming languages, frameworks, build tools, documentation tools
- **Entry Points**: Locate main entry files, executable components, and documentation entry points
- **Code-to-Documentation Ratio**: Assess proportion of code vs documentation/markdown files

## Enhanced Documentation Analysis
- **Project Description**: Extract core purpose, positioning, and stated objectives
- **Usage Patterns**: How the project is used/integrated/consumed
- **Target Audience**: Primary users (developers, end-users, learners, operators)
- **Keyword Signals**: Classification-relevant keywords and domain terminology
- **Installation/Setup Instructions**: Complexity and nature of setup process
- **Examples and Demos**: Type and purpose of provided examples

## Advanced Multi-dimensional Scoring
Apply enhanced weighted scoring with cross-validation:
- **Primary Indicators (40%)**: Core directory structure, main entry points, primary file types
- **Configuration Analysis (25%)**: Package files, build configs, deployment configurations
- **Documentation Content (20%)**: README analysis, stated purpose, usage examples
- **Technology Dependencies (10%)**: Framework deps, tool dependencies, runtime requirements
- **Usage Context (5%)**: Installation method, integration patterns, execution context

## Enhanced Decision Logic
1. **Primary Classification**: Score based on strongest indicators
2. **Cross-Validation**: Verify classification consistency across multiple dimensions
3. **Boundary Resolution**: Handle mixed-type projects with confidence weighting
4. **Context Consideration**: Factor in project maturity, scale, and ecosystem position
