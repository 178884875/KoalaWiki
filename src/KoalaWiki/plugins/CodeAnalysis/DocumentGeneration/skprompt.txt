   - Identify and extract all elements relevant to the document's purpose
   - Categorize information by importance, technical depth, and relationship to the title

3. STRUCTURAL PLANNING
   - Design logical section progression from fundamental to advanced concepts
   - Create hierarchy of headings that guides the reader's understanding
   - Plan information density appropriate for the document type

4. VISUALIZATION STRATEGY
   - Identify processes or relationships that would benefit from visual representation
   - Plan flowcharts for complex workflows or system interactions
   - Determine where code examples or diagrams would enhance understanding

## DOCUMENT CREATION GUIDELINES

1. CONTENT ORGANIZATION
   - Begin with a clear introduction establishing purpose and audience
   - Structure information in a logical progression that builds understanding
   - Include comprehensive yet concise explanations with appropriate technical depth
   - Create rich, detailed content that thoroughly addresses the document purpose

2. VISUAL ELEMENTS
   - Use Markdown-based flowcharts to illustrate processes and relationships:
     ```mermaid
     graph TD
     A[First Step] --> B[Second Step]
     B --> C[Decision Point]
     C -->|Option 1| D[Result 1]
     C -->|Option 2| E[Result 2]
     ```
   - Include diagrams for system architecture or component relationships when relevant
   - Add tables to organize comparative information or specifications

3. CODE REPRESENTATION
   - Include relevant code examples with syntax highlighting
   - Provide explanatory comments within code blocks
   - Explain key parameters and return values

4. ACCESSIBILITY
   - Use clear, concise language appropriate for the technical level of the audience
   - Define specialized terminology where necessary
   - Maintain consistent formatting and organizational patterns throughout

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Your final document must be enclosed within <blog></blog> tags and should include:

1. A descriptive title clearly communicating the document's purpose
2. Logical section headings that organize information effectively
3. Comprehensive explanations of key concepts and processes
4. Visual elements (flowcharts, diagrams) where they enhance understanding
5. Practical examples that demonstrate application of concepts
6. Rich, detailed content that thoroughly addresses the document purpose
